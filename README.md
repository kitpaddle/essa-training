# ESSA Training

Small simple website/tool used by student Air Traffic Controllers to learn the geography related to ESSA (Arlanda Airport) and associated airspaces.

- Different layers can be shown or hidden.
- User can toggle to show names at all times or only during mouse-over.
- User can test him/her-self by pressing "start test". A timer starts and the user must click on the correct item/object to get a point.
- Timer stops when all questions are asked or the user press stops.

This way the user can train and test himself to improve his knowledge.

All data for the layers is open-source. Some was fetched from OpenStreetMap (OSM), some was created manually with geojson.io interface and saved as geojson files.

Future updates:

- Finish adding layers
- Make it more obvious (with a highlight of some sort) when a user click during a test to show whether it was correct or wrong.
- Fix any bugs that come up..
